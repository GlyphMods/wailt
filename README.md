A small utility mod that displays a toast on-screen when the game music changes, with support for music
from other mods as well.

## Contribute track information

If WAILT doesn't support music added by a mod, it's easy to add it yourself if you have some familiarity with JSON!
Documentation on how to do that can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).
